STONWriter serializes objects using the Smalltalk Object Notation format. 

Customization options are:

- prettyPrint <Boolean> default is false
	if true, produce pretty printed output
- newLine <String> default is String cr
	what sequence to use for EOL
- jsonMode <Boolean> default is false
	if true, the follow changes occur
	- strings are delimited with double quotes
	- nil is encoded as null
	- symbols are treated as strings
	- only STON listClass and STON mapClass instances are allowed as composite objects
	it is wise to also use either #error or #ignore as referencePolicy to avoid references
- referencePolicy <#normal|#ignore|#error> default is #normal
	if #normal, track and count object references and use references to implement sharing and break cycles
	if #error, track object references and signal STONWriterError when a shared reference is encountered
	if #ignore, don't track object references which might loop forever on cycles
 - keepNewLines <Boolean> default is false
	if true, any newline sequence CR, LF or CRLF inside strings or symbols will not be escaped 
	but will be written as the newline EOF convention
